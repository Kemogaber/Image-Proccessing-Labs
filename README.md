# Image-Processing-Labs

In this repository, I explore various image processing techniques to enhance and manipulate images. Each technique is implemented to achieve specific improvements, like adjusting contrast, reducing noise, and improving clarity.

## Techniques
### Histogram Equalization
Enhances the contrast of images by spreading out the intensity values, resulting in better visual quality.
